# CDT-Red-Team-Tool

This tool will be used for the second CDT competition during the Spring 2025 semester at RIT. It is a rather simple bash script, and it simply creates 50 users with randomized names,
assigns them passwords based on a pattern I provided, and give sudo privileges to the accounts. This script will be run once root access is already obtained. This will provide users other than root for my team to use, allowing us to lock people out of root as an option.
